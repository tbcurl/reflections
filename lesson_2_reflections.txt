What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You tell git that you want it to track all of your commits moving forward.  If you don't do this, you won't have a record of any of your 
past commits or be able to backtrack.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's like a purgatory for the files -- an inbetween where they are neither in the working directory or the repository.  To be honest, 
I don't see much value.  It seems like it would be pretty simple to just select the files I want to add to the repository and move them
straight in.  I'm sure I'm about to find out why this is not a great idea.
